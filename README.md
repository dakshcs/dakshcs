*building things, breaking things, learning things; usually in that order*

## about me

```javascript
const daksh = {
    location: "Delhi, India",
    title: "student",
    approach: "say yes first, code frantically, deliver something better than expected",
    currentFocus: ["anything that sounds interesting", "whatever breaks next"],
    funFact: "I once fixed a VB script by pure spite for Excel"
};
```

### i'm a functional polymath...
#### ie. i specialize in taking on things i technically shouldn't know how to do yet, learning them unreasonably fast, and producing results that make people question whether i actually just learned it. 
this chaos-driven approach has resulted in me learning: web dev, mobile apps, video/photo/audio editing, music production, 3D modeling, UI/UX, robotics, electronics, PCB design, CAD, hardware modding, soldering, game modding, a concerning amount of repair work and science-y things.

### my learning philosophy

accept task → panic → research furiously → build thing → fix till thing works → repeat

## 📊 stats

i don't believe more lines of code/number of commits/consistency of commits means better code. when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. for any differing opinions, you may refer to [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law).

**TL;DR:** people who don't know what they're talking about should not be making decisions about said thing.

## random stuff i feel is important to put here

- **learned cinematography, audio design and modding** via video game camera mods (shoutout to [Matti Hietanen](https://x.com/Hattiwatt1) and [Mikhael Sharov](https://www.artstation.com/miksharov) for enabling this madness)
- **fixed printers** multiple times (humanity's greatest challenge)
- **won robotics competitions** with robots assembled the night before (procrastination-driven development)
- **built competition drones** that actually flew (surprising everyone, including myself)
- **can argue politics** as well as debug code (equally exhausting, equally satisfying)
